# InvestEdu - Investor Education Platform

A comprehensive investor education platform designed to enhance retail investor education and engagement in the securities market.

## Problem Statement

Many retail investors lack the knowledge to navigate the securities market, leading to poor investment decisions or reliance on unverified advice. Further, most of the online sources of information for retail investors are in English and thus there is lack of educative material in various vernacular languages.

## Solution

Develop an interactive app that educates users on:

- Stock market basics
- Risk assessment techniques
- Algo trading / HFT
- Portfolio diversification

Using delayed market data and simulated trading scenarios - a prototype app with engaging tutorials, quizzes, and a virtual trading feature that tracks learning progress. The platform also translates material into vernacular languages and summarizes content available on other sites, such as websites of SEBI / NISM / stock exchanges.
